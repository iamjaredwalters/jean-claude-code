# CLAUDE AGENT INTERFACE

*"Listen to me. I am like this project - simple but powerful, you understand?"*

This is a command-line interface that connects to Claude AI through Anthropic's API. With this tool, you can chat with Claude and let him execute commands on your files. BAM! Just like that.

## What It Does

You know what? In life, like in coding, sometimes you need a tool that does the splits between human and machine. This tool does exactly that:

- üß† Chat with Claude through your terminal
- üîß Let Claude read your files - BOOM!
- üìÅ Let Claude list your directories - KAPOW!
- üìù Let Claude edit your files - WHAM!

## How To Use

1. Make sure you have your `.env` file with your Anthropic API key like this:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```
   go run main.go
   ```

3. Start chatting with Claude. The interface is in your terminal - like me in an action movie, it's direct and to the point!

## The Code

The code? It's like my muscles - very clean, very organized. You have:
- Tools for file operations
- A clean agent interface
- Just enough power to be dangerous

## Be Aware!

*"Be careful what you ask Claude to do with your files. In martial arts, in coding, and in life - with great power comes great responsibility!"*
